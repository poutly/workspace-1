# HOW TO MAKE A PERSONAL WEBSITE
# ùüè. ***INSTALL***
*Note: You can install the latest versions from these sites, or the ones I currently use that work for me. 
<br>*PC, Windows x64; I currently use HerokuCLI ver. x64, Git-2.23.0-x64, and VSCode-1.38.0-insider-x64.
<br>- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli>
<br>- <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
<br>- <https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/>

# ùüê. ***MAKE ACCOUNTS /APP/REPOSITORY***
Now you need to set up the coding platforms. 
<br>- <https://signup.heroku.com/> (Web hosting)
<br>- <https://github.com/join> (Backup Storage)
<br>- <https://www.name.com/account/create/>* (Custom URL, optional, $)
<br>- <https://freenom.com/> (free URL, shady)
<br>*Make Freenom OR Name.com. Pick one.

<br>a. Make a new heroku app at <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps>
<br>b. Make a new github repository at <https://github.com/new> 
<br>*Make sure your repository is not private.

# ùüë. ***SET UP YOUR VSCODE (CODING ENVIRONMENT)***
a. Make a folder where you want to store your code. Name it something recognizable like your intended site name. 
<br>I named mine `workspace-1`
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VXSiEUi.png" width="500">
<br>
<br>b. Open the folder in VSCode.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YnSo4Uj.png" width="500">
<br>
<br>c. Make a new folder within your workspace. For example, *content*
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXvMVTL.png">
<br>
<br>d. Make a `index.html` within your content folder. In your new file, type something like: 
<br>```If you see this message, VSCode is connected to the Heroku app!```
<br>*The index page is the main page. It would be what you see first when you type in your url. 
<br>*For example, https://example.com*
<br>*Other pages would be named differently such as `page2.php`, and to get to it you'd need to put https://example.com/page2
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/a8jSXyZ.png">
<br>
<br>e. Make an `index.php` page in your workspace. Then, copy and paste (CTRL+S to save):
<br>```<?php require 'content/index.html' ?>```
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AzMocyH.png" width="500">
<br>
<br>f. Now go to your terminal bash.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MSOeluZ.png" width="500">
<br>
<br>g. Set up your git bash terminal.
<br>- Open Visual Studio Code and press and hold Ctrl + ` to open the terminal.
<br>- Open the command palette using Ctrl + Shift + P .
<br>- Type - Select Default Shell.
<br>- Select Git Bash from the options.
<br>- Click on the + icon in the terminal window.
<br>- The new terminal now will be a Git Bash terminal.

# ùüí. ***SETTING UP HEROKU***
a. Log into Heroku within VSCode by typing this into the bash: ```heroku login```
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zl44hkl.png" width="500">
<br>ÔΩ• Press enter after it says:
<br>`heroku: Press any key to open up the browser to login or q to exit`
<br>ÔΩ• Heroku sign in should pop up into your browser, log into it with your Heroku credentials.
<br>
<br>b. To connect VSCode to the Heroku app, input these into the bash terminal, then press enter after each one: 
<br>```$ git init```
<br>```$ heroku git:remote -a workspace-1``` 
<br>
<br>c. To publish your code to the Heroku app, type something into `index.html`, and CTRL+S.
<br>Put this into the bash terminal, then press enter: 
<br>```$ git add .```
<br>```$ git commit -am "1st commit"```
<br>```$ git push heroku master```
<br>Check how your code/content looks at your app url, mine is located at: <https://workspace-1.herokuapp.com/>

# ùüì. ***BACKING UP YOUR CODE WITH GITHUB***
a. Go to <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/workspace-1/deploy/github>. Replace <workspace-1> with your workspace's name as needed.
<br>Search your repository name and connect.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/s94aA5I.png" width="500">
<br>
<br>b. Enable automatic deploys. This connects Heroku to Github whenever you deploy changes to your Heroku app.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/D71T6uI.png" width="500">

# ùüî. ***PUSHING TO GITHUB***
You need to connect the repository to your VSCode bash by inputting:
<br>```$ git remote add origin https://github.com/unrancid/workspace-1.git```
<br>```$ git push -u origin master```
<br>*If you try to push but it gives you this error, input:
<br>```$ git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories```
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mqP6hNk.png" width="500">

# ùüï. ***DOMAIN***
a. Firstly, choose a domain. Personally I use <https://name.com/> to host my domain. 
<br>*For a free domain, I use http://www.freenom.com/en/index.html. Freenom IS shady so use a completely fake name, address, and VPN if you use it. DO NOT buy from them.

# ùüñ. ***CONNECTING DOMAIN SITE TO HEROKU***
a. Go to <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/workspace-1/settings>
to add your domain. Type out the full domain WITHOUT `http://` or `https://`. 
<br>You need to generate 2 codes with two variations of your domain. One with `www.` and one without.
<br>For example, your domain `example.com` would be input as `example.com` and `www.example.com`
<br>Pre-Req. needs a valid credit card to add domains, no money needed.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iJ8Jau6.png" width="500">
<br>Now go to your domain site. Make sure your ANAME matches with your BARE url. 
<br>CNAME matches with your `www.` url.
<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MSenY4l.png" width="500">

# ùüó. ***BEAUTIFY THE DOMAIN***
a. Go here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ILHlE6mLIBin2MqDfeg2IuBxULrrsF26 and an .htaccess file has been made. 
<br>Drop this into your workspace.
<br>
<br>b. Replace `unrancid` and your `.com` to your personal domain that you own. There is 2 lines that you have to substitute. If you need to, CTRL+F to find all the needed substitutes.
<br>*DO NOT touch ANYTHING else.
<br>**For example**, if my domain were http://example.com/, it would look like this:
