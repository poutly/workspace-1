# ùüè. ***INSTALL***
*Note: You can install the latest versions from these sites, or the ones I currently use that work for me. 
<br>*PC, Windows x64; I currently use HerokuCLI ver. x64, Git-2.23.0-x64, and VSCode-1.38.0-insider-x64.
<br>- <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli>
<br>- <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
<br>- <https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/>

# ùüê. ***MAKE ACCOUNTS /APP/REPOSITORY***
<br>- <https://signup.heroku.com/> (Web hosting)
<br>- <https://github.com/join> (Backup Storage)
<br>- <https://www.name.com/account/create/>* (Custom URL, optional, $)
<br>- <https://freenom.com/> (free URL, shady)
<br>*Make Freenom OR Name.com. Pick one.

<br>a. Make a new heroku app at <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps>
<br>b. Make a new github repository at <https://github.com/new> 
<br>*Make sure your repository is not private.

# ùüë. ***SET UP YOUR VSCODE (CODING ENVIRONMENT)***
a. Make a folder where you want to store your code. Name it something recognizable like your intended site name. I named mine `workspace-1`

<br>b. Open the folder in VSCode.

<br>c. Make a new folder within your workspace. For example, *content*

<br>d. Make a `index.html` within your content folder. In your new file, type something like: 
```If you see this message, VSCode is connected to the Heroku app!```
<br>*The index page is the main page. It would be what you see first when you type in your url. *For example, https://example.com*
<br>*Other pages would be named differently such as `page2.php`, and to get to it you'd need to put https://example.com/page2
